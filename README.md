# Credit Card Financial Data Dashboard
## Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of credit card customer and transaction data. The primary aim is to visualize key insights about customer spending patterns, transaction volumes, and overall financial trends using a dashboard created in PowerBI. The dataset was preprocessed using SQL, and the visualizations were designed to provide a holistic view of financial behaviors and transaction activities.

## Project Structure
SQL Preprocessing : SQL was used to clean, transform, and filter the raw data. Key operations included:
1) Handling missing values in customer and transaction datasets.
2) Aggregating transaction data to identify patterns in customer spending.
3) Joining multiple tables to create a unified dataset for analysis.

**PowerBI Visualizations:** After data preprocessing, PowerBI was used to create dynamic and interactive visualizations. These visualizations provide insights into:
**Transaction Volume:** Total and average transaction amounts, segmented by time and customer.
**Customer Segmentation:** Distribution of customers based on transaction frequency and total spending.
**Monthly Trends:** Monthly and yearly trends in credit card usage, highlighting periods of high and low spending.
**Customer Loyalty:** Insights into repeat customers versus new customers, providing an understanding of customer retention and loyalty.

## Key Insights
**Customer Spending Patterns**: A significant portion of customers are high spenders, with a clear trend of increased transactions during specific months, likely driven by promotions or seasonal factors.
**Transaction Distribution**: Most transactions are concentrated within a particular spending range, with a notable portion of high-value transactions coming from a small percentage of customers.
**Monthly Trends:** The data reveals a peak in transactions during certain months, indicating possible seasonal spikes in credit card usage.
**Customer Retention**: Analysis of customer loyalty shows that repeat customers contribute significantly to the overall transaction volume.
